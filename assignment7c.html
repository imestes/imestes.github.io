    <p> All I’ve ever wanted was to be in college.</p>
    <p> When you’re young, everyone wants to know what you want 
        to be when you grow up. All I could ever picture was me 
        on a campus somewhere, grinning and with an armful of 
        textbooks about history and art and calculus and writing. 
        I told them, “I want to be a college student.” And, 
        naturally, I dedicated the first eighteen years of my life 
        to becoming one. </p>
    <p> I still don’t feel very grown up, 
        but I am finally a college student. </p>
    <p> In all honesty, it’s exhausting. I’m told it’s all worth it. 
        “The best four years of your life,” they say. 
        “All you have to do is pass.” That’s never made much sense 
        to me, because all I really want to do is learn. 
        <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56222/sonnet-123-no-time-thou-shalt-not-boast-that-i-do-change">
        To do things little-me would be proud of. </a></p>
    <p> <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48859/song-of-the-open-road">
        I guess I could drop out. </a> 
        Get a job at a coffee shop, find a cute little apartment, 
        adopt a few cats. Make the most of it. </p>
    <p> I don’t think that sounds so bad, but my mom doesn’t want 
        to hear it. <a href="https://allpoetry.com/On-a-Columnar-Self">
        I’ve stopped bringing it up. </a></p>
    <p> I could graduate. Make it out with a diploma and a blank 
        resume, ready to take on the world with a go-get-em attitude. 
        I think I could pull it off. Maybe I could even find an 
        internship or a job right away, 
        <a href="http://www.poemtree.com/poems/YonderSeeTheMorning.htm">
        if I’m one of the lucky ones. </a></p>
    <p> Or maybe I could find someone to marry me. 
        I bet I could find someone reasonable, settle down, 
        let them be the one with the plan. Wouldn’t be so bad, </p>
    <p> <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken">
        right?</a></p>
    <p> Maybe I could buy a little farm. Just me and a cow, 
        a flock of chickens, a plot of land. The world needs 
        more farmers, after all. I could become super great at 
        canning vegetables and making jam. Maybe I’d even become 
        locally famous, featured in a magazine or two. 
        <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=38102">
        “Local college grad risks it all, 
        pursues agrarian life.” </a></p>
    <p> In truth, none of this feels right. Every hypothetical 
        involves sacrificing pieces of myself, giving up the 
        “learning” part of being a college student that I 
        actually enjoy. I want to learn everything: </p>
    <p> how to watercolor paint, </p>
    <p> how to be a good friend, </p>
    <p> how to throw the kind of house party everyone talks 
        about in those “remember when” scenarios, </p>
    <p> how to knit a sweater, </p>
    <p> how to be <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43948/i-am">
        me. </a></p>
