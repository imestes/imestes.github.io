    <h1>5 Recipes That Are a Sure Thing in an Uncertain
        Time

    <p>Back in March, during those first terrifying 
        weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, 
        I started writing a series of articles as a 
        way to help cooks figure out how to use the 
        mountain of beans and pasta 
        many of us had manically laid in, in case we 
        couldn’t, or didn’t feel comfortable, 
        leaving the house.
    </p>

    <p>Called From the Pantry, it was intended to provide 
        recipes that were versatile enough to cut down on 
        anxiety-ridden trips to the supermarket, while still
        being satisfying to eat and calming to cook. 
        The recipes, written narratively, were a real-time 
        kitchen diary, based on what I had in my own pantry, 
        and created with an eye toward giving readers 
        wiggle room to use what was in theirs.
